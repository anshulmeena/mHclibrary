<li class="textbox">
<p> LSSI is a library services firm founded by librarians. As the national corporate leader in 
library management services since 1981, we feel a great responsibility to leverage and share the 
collective experience of hundreds of our top library professionals.  Whereas an individual library 
can become isolated and out-of-date, our nationwide library network puts fresh ideas based on sound 
library practices into play every new day.
