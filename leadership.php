<li class="textbox">
<p>	At LSSI, we create an environment that brings our librarians out from behind the scenes and 
outfront serving their customers. We work with local library boards and interest groups to develop 
programs specific to the needs of the community. And, we carefully listen to civic managers, and 
design thoughtful library solutions that meet growth, funding and community challenges.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="graytitle">Innovation</span>
<ul class="pageitem">
<li class="textbox">
<p> A major focus of our brand promise is to help envision and deliver the next generation of 
libraries, fully leveraging advanced online information services and automation technologies.  
Because of our scope LSSI is better positioned than any single library or library system to 
bring exciting, new, and valuable solutions to the communities and institutions we serve.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="graytitle">Experience</span>
<ul class="pageitem">
<li class="textbox">
<p> LSSI is a library services firm founded by librarians. As the national corporate leader in 
library management services since 1981, we feel a great responsibility to leverage and share the 
collective experience of hundreds of our top library professionals.  Whereas an individual library 
can become isolated and out-of-date, our nationwide library network puts fresh ideas based on sound 
library practices into play every new day.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<span class="graytitle">Opportunity</span>
<ul class="pageitem">
<li class="textbox">
<p> LSSI is proud to be a force for new opportunity.  As one of the largest employers of library 
professionals, we create new career opportunities every day. As creative problem solvers, we bring 
new options and opportunities to challenged communities and community leaders.  Our vision for the 
brighter future for libraries fuels the opportunities we create, and betters the communities we serve.
